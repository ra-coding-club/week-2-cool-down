### Questions

Example Question: This article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model (___), how CSS is applied to parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is used to actually include our CSS in our web page.

1. Name the two other markup languages mentioned in the article.

2. In technical terms, what does it mean to present a document. **Quote the article.**

3. Explain what a CSS rule is formed from. 

4. Summarize the two steps for how CSS actually works.

5. In your own words, explain the three ways to apply your CSS to your HTML.

**Read [CSS Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Syntax) and answer the following questions below.**

6. *"CSS is a declarative language, which makes its syntax fairly easy and straightforward to understand. In addition, it also has a very nice error recovery system that allows you to make mistakes without breaking everything — for example declarations that aren't understood are generally just ignored."* But what is the downside (quote the article)?

7. Define the two building blocks of CSS.

8. Type an example of a CSS Declaration.

9. *True or False* - A declaration block may be empty — this is perfectly valid.

10. Summarize the ***CSS Selectors and Rules*** section of the article.

11. Identify and explain in your own words the three ways to make CSS readable.

**Read [Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors) and answer the following question below.**

12. Identify and explain in your own words the six categories of selectors.

**Read [Simple Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Simple_selectors) and answer the following questions below.**

13. ____ Selectors aka Element Selectors

14. What does a class selector consist of?

15. Why must an ID name be unique in the document?

16. The _________ selector (`*`) is the ultimate joker. It allows selecting all elements in a page. As it is rarely useful to apply a style to every element on a page, it is often used in combination with other selectors.

**Read [Cascade and Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance) and answer the following questions below.**

17. ___ is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets, which indicates that the notion of the cascade is important. At its most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter, but it's more complex than that. 

18. What selectors win out in the cascade depends on what three factors (these are listed in order of weight — earlier ones will overrule later ones)?

19. *In CSS, there is a special piece of syntax you can use to make sure that a certain declaration will always win over all others* - what is it?

20. ___________ is basically a measure of how specific a selector is — how many elements it could match.

21. What is the simple seven-word definition of *source order*?

22. CSS ___________ is the last piece we need to investigate to get all the information and understand what style is applied to an element. The idea is that some property values applied to an element will be inherited by that element's children, and some won't.

**Read [The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model) and answer the following questions below.**

23. *Every element within a document is structured as a rectangular box inside the document layout, the size and "onion layers" of which can be tweaked using some specific CSS properties.* What is this describing?
